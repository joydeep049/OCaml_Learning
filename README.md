## OCaml Learning
A collection of OCaml Codes and their outputs produced as I was learning OCaml.</br> </br>


### Future??
I do plan to keep on adding more codes. Feel free to collaborate and raise issues. </br> </br>

### Outputs
I also add screenshots of the outputs of my outputs.</br>
Currently I'm using utop on WSL to compile OCaml Code. </br>
